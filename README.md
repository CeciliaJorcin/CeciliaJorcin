ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Cecilia, a software developer with a different story... I started my career in software development, working in front end and back end using various technologies such as VB and C# .NET, PHP, JS, HTML, CSS and Java among other from 2003 to 2011.

In 2011, I decided to embark on an exciting change of direction and dive into the world of design and creating sewing patterns for children's clothing. During this phase, I self-taught myself in areas like graphic design, user instruction creation, photography, marketing, and social media, all while working from home to raise my young children.

Now, I am ready to return to the IT world. I have been intensively preparing myself in technologies like React JS, HTML, JS, CSS, using modern tools like Visual Studio Code and GitHub. My most recent experience was at upCamp.io, where I acquired and reinforced my knowledge in the development field while working in teams under the Scrum methodology.

My adaptability, creativity, and self-directed learning are key driving forces for me. I am excited to share projects and collaborate with the community of developers on GitHub.
